	Today I made this website! So far I have tabs for my home, journal, projects, and about me pages.
	I'm really excited to make this website look really cool, <br></br> and I can't wait to link all of my other projects. I'm currently working on my organizing website. It's basically I website where I can type in to do lists, see my <br></br>schedule, and have helpful links/notes.The goal is to have it bookmarked so instead of having a bookmark bar, I can just go on my website and access all of my <br></br>helpful links. I'm currently trying to figure out how to make it so I can write notes in the post its on my screen!

	I have made a lot of progress since I first started this webstie. I got rid of my about me page, and completely changed the whole aesthetic and layout. <br></br> Currently, my home page has pink lighting bolts on it, and my journal has a blue cloud and my entry from the other day. I'm trying to make a drop down menu <br></br>on my projects page where people can see all of my projects. None of my projects are online yet and I don't know how to make them online, so I can't link any <br></br> of them just yet. I really want to make a page with my favorite songs and fun things. I don't know what to call it yet though.

I didn't code very much today, but I figured out how to link my person card and my seasons website! I saw this cool confetti effect on this website <br></br>where when someone clicked on a button confetti fell from the top of the screen. I feel like this would be such a cool thing to try!</p>
<center><p class="title1">11/4/2020</p></center>
<p class="p1">Today I learned how to put my website online! Now anybody can go to my website if they search c24tk.github.io !! I also figured out how <br></br> to add a gif of confetti falling on my projects page. I feel like I've made this website as good as I want it can be, so now I'm going to start making <br></br> more projects that can be linked on my projects tab! I'm so excited.</p>

<p class ="p1"> Over the past few days I have spent A LOT of time coding. I was inspired by Raam's website and how he had circles that got bigger when you hovered <br></br> on them, so I thought about how I could incorporate this into a codesketch. I ended up making a website with a diagram of a heart, and when you hover<br></br>over different parts of the heart, you get a little summary about what that part is and what it does! I put it online last night!! I'm thinking about starting a<br></br>series of websites with different organs similar to the Interactive Heart!<br></br>

<p class="p1">I'm doing literally such a bad job of updating my journal. I just finished making another interactive heart website titled "Blood Flow Simulator". I thought that <br></br> it would be much harder than it actaully was. I used a key frames animation to make my divs move and change colors. It was a super helpful codesketch, and I <br></br> think that it taught me a lot. I also make a fun Christmas card website that plays fun music! I have no idea what to work on next, but I like what I have been <br></br> doing with the hearts.  <a href="heart2.html"><br></br> Link to Blood Flow Simulator,</a><a href="christmas.html">    Link to Christmas Card</a></p>

<p class="p1">Currently I am on winter break, and I have a great idea for what I should code next! I want to make a soccer field that has a bunch of cones and other soccer <br></br> equipment. When I click on the equipment, I want to be able to decorate the field with it. I've seen a lot of projects similar to this in Molly's previous classes,<br></br>  usually with Ice Cream and Pizza. I think making a soccer field would be really helpful because I would be able to plan out my training sessions! </p>

<p class="p1">It's 2021 and I have so many cool ideas! I finalized my soccer field codesketch and just put it up on my website. I am currently working on my data codesketch.<br></br> It is gonna represent the amount of TV I watched in 2020. I already got my data and have started my project. Yesterday in class we were supposed to make <br></br>goals. One of my goals is getting better at understanding java script. I'm still a bit confused and I think that not understanding limits me a lot of easier projects.<br></br><a href="soccerfield.html">    Link to Soccer Field</a></p>

<p class="p1">I finished and started my cup game this week! It took A LOT of javaScript and I really think it helped me understand much better. It was very satisfying to make, and <br></br>was a nice break from my data website. I've done a lot of my data website, and I'm hoping to finish sometime soon. I have only a couple more months to add. <br></br><a href="cupball.html">  Link to Cup Game</a></p>

<p class="p1">I finally finished my data codesketch of the shows the got me through 2020! I spent so long working on it, and I'm so happy to finally finish. I don't have any<br></br> specific new ideas for codesketches, but I definitely want to practice using an arrray, a conditional, and a for loop. <br></br> <a href="data.html">  Link to Data Website</a></p>

<p class="p1">This past week I started and finished a website using a conditional! It's a website with pictures of song artists and when you click on them my favorite song of theirs <br></br> plays. I used a conditional to make it so every odd time I clicked it the song paused and every even time I clicked it played. <br></br> <a href="songs.html">  Link to Song Website</a></p>

<p class="p1">A couple of weeks ago I made a list of codesketchs I wanted to make, and I finished them all! This week I made a codesketch using an array that shows <br></br>different movies when you click on a tv! I also used a for loop to make a bunch of hearts. <a href="valentines.html">  <br></br>Link to Valentines Day Movies</a></p>

<p class="p1">I can't believe it is the last week of CS1! I just finished my coding story for my final project and I am presenting it tomorrow. I am going to tell the story of how I <br></br>created a soccer planner and have been using it in my every day life. <a href="reveal.js-master/index.html">  <br></br>Link to Coding Story</a></p>
