<p id="p1">Seeing as though I spent majority of my 2020 watching tv (didn't we all), I think I'm the perfect candidate to give suggestions on what shows to watch. <br></br>
<p id="p4">✰✰✰</p>
</p>
<p id="p3">here are my top 3</p></center>

<p id="p2" class ="one">
<br></br>
1. Ted Lasso
<br></br>
I absolutely adored watching this show. It's only 10 episodes, and is super funny. It's about an American football coach who lands a job coaching a premier league soccer team in England, despite having no knowledge about soccer. It is extremely funny and I 10/10 would recommend. 
<br></br>
2. Cheer
<br></br>
As someone who couldn't care less about cheerleading, I thought that this was the perfect documentary series. It is about a college cheerleading team and their journey to championships. I would also 10/10 recommend watching. Very inspirational. Very exciting. Very entertaining. 
<br></br>
3. Schitt'$ Creek
<br></br>
I was always told to watch this show, and never wanted to, and I'm not gonna lie I absolutely hated it at first, but it has now become one of my favorite shows. If you have a sacarstic sense of humor, you will love this. The characters are hilarious, and the episodes are only 20 minutes long. Definitely check it out. 10/10 would recommend. 
<br></br>

<p id="p5">Honorary mentions:</p>
<p class ="one">
1) Grey's anatomy
<br></br>
Definitely my favorite show of 2020. 17 seasons is a lot of tv to be watching, and I don't encourage that for anyone going into 2021, but given that we were in a global pandemic I think it was a perfect use of my time in 2020.
<br></br>
2) The vampire diaries
<br></br>
I was obsessed with this show during quarantine, and I'm really glad that phase of my life is over. Though I loved it at the time, it was way too time consuming for a show about vampires. 
<br></br>
3) Psych
<br></br>
I only watched the first season of psych, and will definitly start watching that again over spring break. It was really funny, and I don't know why I stopped watching it.
